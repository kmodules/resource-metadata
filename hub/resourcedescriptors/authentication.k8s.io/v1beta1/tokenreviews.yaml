              description: Audiences are audience identifiers chosen by the authenticator
                that are compatible with both the TokenReview and token. An identifier
                is any identifier in the intersection of the TokenReviewSpec audiences
                and the token's audiences. A client of the TokenReview API that sets
                the spec.audiences field should validate that a compatible audience
                identifier is returned in the status.audiences field to ensure that
                the TokenReview server is audience aware. If a TokenReview returns
                an empty status.audience field where status.authenticated is "true",
                the token is valid against the audience of the Kubernetes API server.
