            attachRequired:
              description: attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires
                an attach operation (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume()
                method), and that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call
                the attach volume interface which checks the volumeattachment status
                and waits until the volume is attached before proceeding to mounting.
                The CSI external-attacher coordinates with CSI volume driver and updates
                the volumeattachment status when the attach operation is complete.
                If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the value is
                specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise
                the attach operation will be called.

            podInfoOnMount:
              description: "If set to true, podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume
                driver requires additional pod information (like podName, podUID,
                etc.) during mount operations. If set to false, pod information will
                not be passed on mount. Default is false. The CSI driver specifies
                podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will
                pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume()
                calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and validating the
                information passed in as VolumeContext. The following VolumeConext
                will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow,
                but the prefix will be used. \"csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name\": pod.Name

                is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only required for drivers
                which support both the \"Persistent\" and \"Ephemeral\" VolumeLifecycleMode.
                Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this field.
                As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only support
                one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines
                which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the
                driver."

            volumeLifecycleModes:
              description: volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this
                CSI volume driver supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent",
                which is the usage defined by the CSI specification and implemented
                in Kubernetes via the usual PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is "Ephemeral".
                In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside the pod spec with
                CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of that
                pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to
                get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume. For more information
                about implementing this mode, see https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html
                A driver can support one or more of these modes and more modes may
                be added in the future. This field is beta.
