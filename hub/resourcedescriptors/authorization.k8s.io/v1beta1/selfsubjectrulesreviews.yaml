      description: SelfSubjectRulesReview enumerates the set of actions the current
        user can perform within a namespace. The returned list of actions may be incomplete
        depending on the server's authorization mode, and any errors experienced during
        the evaluation. SelfSubjectRulesReview should be used by UIs to show/hide
        actions, or to quickly let an end user reason about their permissions. It
        should NOT Be used by external systems to drive authorization decisions as
        this raises confused deputy, cache lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns.
        SubjectAccessReview, and LocalAccessReview are the correct way to defer authorization
        decisions to the API server.
