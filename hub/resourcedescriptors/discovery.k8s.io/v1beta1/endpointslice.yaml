                it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is
                a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer
                list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which
                the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting
                for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by
                a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting

        ports:
          description: ports specifies the list of network ports exposed by each endpoint
            in this slice. Each port must have a unique name. When ports is empty,
            it indicates that there are no defined ports. When a port is defined with
            a nil port value, it indicates "all ports". Each slice may include a maximum
            of 100 ports.

                  Non-standard protocols should use prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
