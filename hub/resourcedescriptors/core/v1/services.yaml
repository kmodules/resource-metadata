                a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer
                list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which

                Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified,

                of endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP
                and allocates a port on every node which routes to the clusterIP.
                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the clusterIP.
