                Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will
                remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object
                is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may
                be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because
                it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is
                a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer
                list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which
                the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting
                for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by
                a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting
                in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order
                amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the
